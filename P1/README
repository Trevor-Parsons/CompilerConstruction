FSA Table and Driver
Trevor Parsons

Note: FSA Table is located in: scanner.cpp

Description:
This program reads from either a file or command line input and determines which tokens are
present in the input. It will iterate over the entire file, skipping whitespace, end of line,
and comment (%) strings. An FSA table is used to look up the state and then a token is found
that corresponds with that state. Note that the FSA table is described in detail in scanner.cpp,
and does not include specific keyword or operator states. For keywords and operators, a lookup
is done after the token is read to determine the specific keword or operator found.
