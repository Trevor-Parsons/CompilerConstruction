Assembly Code Generator
Trevor Parsons

=Description=
This program compiles code using the course grammar, generates a parse tree,
and creates assmbly code that can be run on the virtMach program.

The assembly code output can be found in a generated X.asm file, where X
is the name of the inputfile that was used to generate the assembly code.

!Note: The program should be working properly for all aspects of the grammar
except absolute value. The '&' symbol from the grammar will not create any
compiler errors, but the absolute value of the number or identifier that it
preceeds will not be calculated.
