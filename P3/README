Identifier checker
Trevor Parsons

=Description=
This Program build on the previous project by adding error checking for 
undeclared or redeclared identifiers. If an undeclared identifier is used by 
the program, the parser function will generate an appropriate error. 
Similarly, if a variable has already been delcared and then is declared again,
 the parser function will generate an appropriate error.

!NOTE: Because it was specified in the description for P2 (previous project), 
the tree printing function has been commented out. To enable the tree to be 
printed, uncomment out the line containing "printTree(root, 0);" located at 
the bottom of the main() function in main.cpp.

=Running Instrucitons=
Invocaiton: statSem [InputFileName]

Can also be run with console input if a file name is not specified. When the 
user is done inputting text to the console, then they should finish the input 
with ctrl+d to run the parser.
